# timesheet.txt

This project defines a plain text timesheet file format and provides a PythonÂ 3 parser.

## Status

The file format is currently being specified in detail in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/scy/timesheet.txt/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22file+format%22) and [pull request #17](https://github.com/scy/timesheet.txt/pull/17).
Some details may still change, but not a lot.

The parser and Python implementation in [/timesheettxt](timesheettxt) are in alpha and barely useful with some rough edges.
That being said, the main author of this project is already using it for his own freelance work invoices.

You can expect a real (although basic) CLI tool (instead of manually launching a Python script) once we get to 0.1; see our [milestones](https://github.com/scy/timesheet.txt/milestones).

## Editor Support

* The author of this project also provides the [vim-timesheet](https://github.com/scy/vim-timesheet) plugin for Vim with syntax highlighting and some key mappings.

Let me know if you implement support for other editors.

## Design Goals

* The user should be able to create new timesheet entries really quickly.
  When the time tracking system gets in your way, you stop using it, or your entries start to get inaccurate.
* No special software other than a text editor should be required to modify the timesheet.
  This allows you to capture entries using any device that can edit plain text files, or even with a sheet of paper.
* Timesheet entries should not need an explicit end time if another activity was started immediately afterwards.
  Instead, the end time of the first entry should automatically be the start time of the second one.
  Else, changing the times of adjacent entries is a pain and error-prone.
* The format should be easily parsable by a machine, but easy to learn for the end user.
* Comments, completely ignored by the parser (i.e. for the file author only) should be supported, both standalone and associated with an entry.
* For each entry, there should be an easy way to provide
  * a description text
  * a ticket or issue ID (for filtering, reports or export to other software)
  * tags (for filtering and reports)
  * a "billable" flag that can be set explicitly to yes or no, to allow for different defaults based on project or issue.
* Writing entries in different timezones should be possible and easy to do.
* Creating entries across midnight or spanning multiple days should be possible and easy.
* The code that's reading it should handle the case where the most recent entry is still active/open while parsing.
* If the parser does not understand something, it should throw an error instead of ignoring the input.

There are also some anti-goals, i.e. things that the system should _not_ have:

* Description texts should be a single line only.
  This is a timesheet, not a diary.
* Providing multiple issue IDs for a single entry should not be supported because it's hard to automatically export time spent to issue trackers then.

## Done

* define basic file format
* parser understands
  * comments
  * `TZ` lines
  * date lines
  * time entries, but extracting only issue ID and billable flag
  * stop lines
  * continue lines
* timezone handling

## Missing

There are some things that I as the author yet have to implement.
They are [tagged as enhancement](https://github.com/scy/timesheet.txt/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement) in this project's GitHub issues.
I'd be especially happy if you had a look at [items tagged "help wanted"](https://github.com/scy/timesheet.txt/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).
Sometimes you don't even have to code for these, as they are just about the file format or gathering use cases.

If you need anything else, feel free to create a GitHub issue for it, but be prepared to implement it yourself. ðŸ˜‰
